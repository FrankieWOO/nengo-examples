**************
Nengo examples
**************

This repository contains example Nengo models.
Each folder contains a different set of examples,
which may require different parts of the Nengo ecosystem
(e.g., the Nengo GUI),
different external packages
(e.g., the Jupyter notebook)
and may be licensed differently.
Please see the README in each folder for more information
on how to run those specific examples.
