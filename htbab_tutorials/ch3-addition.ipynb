    "In this model, you will see a transformation which is the basic property of single neurons (i.e., addition). Addition transforms two inputs into a single output which is their sum. You will construct a network that adds two inputs. The network utilizes two communication channels going into the same neural population. Addition is somewhat ‘free’, since the incoming currents from different synaptic connections interact linearly."

However as described in the book, you can scale a represented variable by a constant value by changing the transform. Example: if you set the transform of ensemble B to 0 and ensemble A to 2 (i.e., nengo.Connection(input_A, A, transform=[2]) ), the sum will be twice of the input_A. You will also need to set an appropriate radius for the Sum ensemble to avoid saturation when you change the transform values."
