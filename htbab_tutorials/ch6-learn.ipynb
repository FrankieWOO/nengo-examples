    "The model has parameters as described in the book. Note that hPES learning rule is built into Nengo 1.4 as mentioned in the book. The same rule can be implemented in Nengo 2.0 by combining the PES and the BCM rule as shown in the code.  Also, instead of using the 'gate' and 'switch' as described in the book, 'inhibit' population is used which serves the same purpose of turning off the learning by inhibiting the error population. For computing the actual error (which is required only for analysis), direct mode can be used by specifying the neuron_type as 'nengo.Direct()' while creating the 'actual_error' ensemble.\n",

    "When you run the model, you will see that the 'post' population gradually learns to compute the communication channel. In the model, you will inhibit the error population after 15 seconds to turn off learning and you will see that the 'post' population will still track the 'pre' population showing that the model has actually learned the input. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model can also learn other functions by using an appropriate error signal. For example to learn a square function, comment out the lines marked 'Communication Channel' and uncomment the lines marked 'Square' in the code. Run the model again and you will see that the model successfully learns the square function."
