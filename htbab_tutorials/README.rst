Tutorials from How to Build a Brain
***********************************

The Jupyter notebooks in this directory
follow the structure of the tutorials published in
`How to Build a Brain (Eliasmith, 2015) <https://www.amazon.com/dp/0190262125/>`_.
They have been updated to use the syntax
of `Nengo 2+ <https://github.com/nengo/nengo>`_,
and to run in Jupyter notebooks.

The original tutorials were written by
Chris Eliasmith and Matthew Gingerich.
They were adapted by Sugandha Sharma.

============

You will need Python installed with the following packages:

- `jupyter <http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>`_
- `nengo <https://www.nengo.ai/nengo/getting_started.html>`_
- `nengo-gui <https://github.com/nengo/nengo-gui#installation>`_

Usage
=====

To run these notebooks,
`start the Jupyter notebook <http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html>`_
and navigate to this directory.
Click on the ``.ipynb`` file you wish to run.
The notebook cells contain the relevant code,
so you only need to run those cells.
