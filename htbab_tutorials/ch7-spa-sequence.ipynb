In Nengo 1.4 (book) separate 'Rules' and 'Sequence' classes were created, however, this is not needed in Nengo 2.0 since you can directly specify the rules using the built-in 'Actions' class in spa (semantic pointer architecutre) package.

The first parameter 'module' refers to name of the module that you want to provide input to and the second parameter 'function' refers to the function to execute to generate inupts to that module. The functions should always return strings, which will then be parsed by the relevant vocabulary.\n",
